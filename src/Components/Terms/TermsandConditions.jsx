        <h2>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h2>
        <div className="termsContent">
          <h6>Your use of this platform is governed by these terms</h6>
          <p>
            By accessing or using Deen Car Show, you agree to comply with the terms outlined here. 
            This website serves as a platform for viewing, reserving, and purchasing premium and 
            exotic vehicles. All users are expected to act responsibly and provide accurate 
            information during inquiries or transactions.
          </p>
          
          <h6>Use of the content on this website</h6>
          <p>
            All content on this platform, including images, vehicle specs, and pricing, is 
            protected and provided for informational purposes only. You may not reuse, replicate, 
            or misrepresent any listings or materials unless granted written permission by Deen 
            Car Show. Vehicle availability and specifications are subject to change without notice.
          </p>

          <h6>How long will it take to get my vehicle?</h6>
          <p>
            Delivery timelines vary depending on the buyer’s location, vehicle condition, 
            and documentation processing. On average, domestic deliveries may take 5–10 business days 
            post-payment. For international shipping, estimated timelines will be provided upon 
            confirmation of payment and paperwork. Expedited services are available upon request.
          </p>

          <h6>Will I receive the exact car I see in the picture?</h6>
          <p>
            Yes — each vehicle listed includes real, high-resolution images of the actual car. 
            What you see is what you get. We do not use stock photos for listings. All cars are 
            thoroughly inspected, and additional media (videos, 360 views) can be requested 
            before purchase.
          </p>

          <h6>Limitation of liability</h6>
          <p>
            Deen Car Show is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages 
            arising from use of the platform or any transactions conducted through it. While we 
            thoroughly vet sellers and listings, final inspection and due diligence remain the 
            responsibility of the buyer before completing any transaction.
          </p>

          <h6>Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h6>
          <p>
            These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the 
            Republic of Kenya. Any disputes arising under or in connection with these terms 
            shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Nairobi, Kenya.
